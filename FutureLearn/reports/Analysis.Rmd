## Analysis of Demographic Information by Archetype Classificiation 

The key components of information pertaining to learner demographic are:

* Gener
* Age
* Education Level 
* Employment Status
* Employment Sector 
* Country of Residence 

Using the "enrol_leave_arch" data set, I undertook to investigate each of these areas to identify trends.  

### Age by Arcehtype Class 

``` {r age by archetype, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
 #relative proportion age by archetype
arch_age_prop=enrol_leave_arch %>% 
  filter(age_range!="Unknown") %>% 
  group_by(age_range, archetype) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  mutate(freq=n/sum(n))

#age proportion 
ggplot(data=arch_age_prop)+geom_bar(aes(x=age_range, y=n, fill = factor(arch_age_prop$archetype)),stat = "identity")
```

```{r age percentage, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
V46_55=arch_age_prop %>%
  filter(age_range=="46-55", archetype=="Vitalisers")%>% 
  pull(var=-1)
V65=arch_age_prop %>% 
  filter(age_range==">65", archetype=="Vitalisers") %>% 
  pull(var=-1)
E26_35=arch_age_prop %>% 
  filter(age_range=="26-35", archetype=="Explorers") %>% 
  pull(var=-1)
E36_45=arch_age_prop %>% 
  filter(age_range=="36-45", archetype=="Explorers") %>% 
  pull(var=-1)
maxage=arch_age_prop %>% 
  filter(age_range=="46-55") %>% 
  pull(var=-2)

```

Data has been provided for `r sum(arch_age_prop[,3])` learners. 

As shown in the graph above, the majority of learners fall within the 46-55 age range (`r sum(maxage)` learners)  

Vitalisers make up the majority of 46-55 (`r  round(V46_55*100,digits=1)`%) and >65 (`r round(V65*100,digits=1)`%) age ranges.  Explorers are most represented within the 26-35 (`r round(E26_35*100,digits=1)`%) and 36-45 (`r round(E36_45*100,digits=1)`%) age ranges.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
